## Executive Summary
This case study examines purchasing patterns in the chip category across different customer segments for a retail chain. Using transaction data and customer loyalty information, we analyzed how different demographic groups purchase chips, revealing key insights about pricing sensitivity, package size preferences, and brand loyalty. The analysis identified several high-value customer segments and opportunities for targeted marketing strategies to drive category growth.

## Business Context
A major retailer wanted to understand customer purchasing behavior in the chip category to develop more effective targeted marketing campaigns. The primary objective was to identify customer segments with the highest value and potential for growth, while developing actionable insights on price sensitivity, package size preferences, and brand preferences across different customer segments.

## Data Overview
The analysis utilized two main datasets:

#### 1. Transaction Data - Containing details of chip purchases including:
  * Transaction date and ID
  * Store number
  * Loyalty card number
  * Product details (name, quantity, sales amount)
  * Product characteristics derived from name (brand, package size)
#### 2. Customer Data - Containing demographic information about customers:
  * Loyalty card number
  * Lifestage (e.g., YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES, RETIREES, OLDER FAMILIES)
  * Premium Customer status (Budget, Mainstream, Premium)

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
  * Removed duplicate transactions and customers
  * Standardized product names and extracted package sizes
  * Calculated unit prices
  * Merged transaction and customer data
### Customer Segmentation Analysis
  * Analyzed sales by lifestage and premium customer segments
  * Calculated average unit price by segment
  * Identified package size preferences by segment
  * Analyzed purchase frequency by segment
  * Determined brand preferences across segments
### Data Visualization
  * Created visualizations to communicate key findings
  * Developed heatmaps for segment comparison
  * Generated charts for sales trends, brand preferences, and segment contributions

## Key Findings
### 1. **Sales Distribution Across Customer Segments**
The analysis revealed that sales are not evenly distributed across customer segments, with certain demographic groups contributing significantly more to total chip sales:

  * **Lifestage Impact:** OLDER FAMILIES, YOUNG FAMILIES, and RETIREES showed the highest total sales.
  * **Premium Status Impact:** Mainstream customers accounted for the largest share of chip sales.
  * **Combined Segmentation:** The highest-performing segments were combinations like OLDER FAMILIES-Mainstream and YOUNG FAMILIES-Mainstream.

### 2. **Price Sensitivity Analysis**
Different customer segments showed varying levels of price sensitivity:

  * Premium customers across all lifestages consistently paid higher unit prices.
  * Budget customers typically purchased chips at lower unit prices.
  * YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES in the Premium segment showed the highest average unit price, suggesting less price sensitivity.

### 3. **Package Size Preferences**
Package size preferences varied significantly across segments:

  * OLDER SINGLES/COUPLES and RETIREES typically preferred larger package sizes.
  * YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES and YOUNG FAMILIES tended to purchase smaller package sizes.
  * Budget customers generally preferred larger packages, possibly seeking better value for money.

### 4. **Purchase Frequency and Quantity**
The analysis of transaction frequency revealed interesting patterns:

  * OLDER FAMILIES and RETIREES had the highest number of chip transactions.
  * Budget customers across lifestages made more frequent but smaller purchases.
  * Premium customers purchased larger quantities per transaction but less frequently.

### 5. **Brand Preferences**
Brand preferences showed significant variation across segments:

  * Mainstream brands dominated overall sales.
  * Premium customers showed stronger preference for specialty chip brands.
  * YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES in the Premium segment showed the strongest affinity for premium brands.
  * Certain brands had particularly strong performance in specific segments, suggesting targeted marketing opportunities.






## Strategic Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following strategies:

### 1. Targeted Marketing Initiatives
  * **High-Value Segment Focus:** Develop targeted promotions for the highest-value segments (OLDER FAMILIES-Mainstream, YOUNG FAMILIES-Mainstream).
  * **Premium Customer Engagement:** Create premium brand campaigns specifically for YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES in the Premium segment, highlighting quality and unique flavors.
  * **Budget Customer Value Proposition:** For Budget customers, emphasize value for money and consider bulk package promotions.

### 2. Product Assortment Optimization
  * **Package Size Strategy:** Ensure appropriate package size availability based on segment preferences (larger sizes for OLDER SINGLES/COUPLES and RETIREES, smaller convenient options for YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES).
  * **Brand Mix Management:** Optimize the brand and product mix in different stores based on the dominant customer segments in each location.

### 3. Pricing Strategy
  * **Segment-Based Pricing:** Consider different pricing strategies for price-sensitive segments vs. premium segments.
  * **Promotion Structure:** Structure promotions differently (e.g., percentage discounts vs. multi-buy offers) based on segment preferences.

### 4. Growth Opportunities
  * **Cross-Segment Expansion:** Identify strategies to encourage customers to try products from adjacent segments.
  * **Underperforming Segment Development:** Develop specific strategies to grow sales in underperforming segments.

## Implementation Plan

### Short-term Actions (1-3 months):
  * Launch targeted promotions for top 3 highest-value segments
  * Adjust in-store product placement based on segment purchasing patterns
  * Test different promotion types across different segments

### Medium-term Strategy (3-6 months):
  * Implement refined pricing strategy by segment
  * Develop segment-specific marketing communications
  * Optimize package size availability by store based on local customer demographics

### Long-term Initiatives (6-12 months):
  * Build segment-specific loyalty program enhancements
  * Develop new products targeted at high-potential segments
  * Implement data-driven category management approach across all stores



## Expected Impact
The implementation of these recommendations is expected to result in:

  * 5-7% growth in overall chip category sales
  * 10-15% increase in sales from premium customers
  * 3-5% improvement in margin through optimized pricing and promotion strategy
  * Enhanced customer loyalty through more relevant offers and product assortment

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates the power of customer segmentation in developing targeted marketing strategies. By understanding the distinct purchasing behaviors of different customer segments, the retailer can create more personalized and effective marketing campaigns, optimize product assortment, and implement more strategic pricing to drive category growth and improve customer satisfaction.

The findings highlight the importance of moving beyond broad demographic classifications to understand the nuanced behaviors of specific customer segments. This approach allows for more precise targeting and higher marketing ROI compared to mass-market strategies.
